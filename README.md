# Youtube-Video-Summarizer

YouTube Transcript to Summary App
This app is a user-friendly tool built with Streamlit that allows you to quickly get summarized notes from any YouTube video that has a transcript available.

How It Works
Input YouTube Video Link: You enter the link of the YouTube video you want to summarize.

Transcript Extraction: The app extracts the video's transcript automatically using the youtube-transcript-api. This step fetches the spoken text from the video if captions or subtitles are available.

Video Thumbnail Display: It shows the thumbnail image of the video to confirm the correct video is being processed.

AI-Powered Summarization: The extracted transcript is sent to Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, a powerful language model that reads through the text and generates a concise summary in easy-to-understand points within 250 words.

Display Summary: The app then displays this summarized content as detailed notes, helping you grasp the main ideas and key points quickly without watching the entire video.
